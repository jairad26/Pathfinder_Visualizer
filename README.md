# Pathfinder_Visualizer
Using Dijkstra's, Greedy Best First, and A* Pathfinding Algorithms to find the shortest distance between two points. Can also add obstacles, or generate obstacles randomly as well.

You may choose from 3 different pathfinding algorithms from the drop down menu (A*, Best First, Dijkstra's). Enter a starting and ending node separated by a comma when prompted (i.e. 3,4 or 43,44). Press show steps to watch algorithm in action. Press "m" when on grid to randomly create some blocks, and you may draw on the grid using your mouse as well to create obstacles. Press space bar to run and enjoy!
